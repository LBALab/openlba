# openlba
## A Little Big Adventure series engine reimplementation

Community driver project to enhance the original game engine, fix bugs, add support for modern systems and multiple platforms.
It mergers multiple efforts from the community done so far but staled or unmaintained with the goal to create a single code base for all games in the series.

Little Big Adventure (aka Relentless: Twinsen's Adventure) is an action-adventure game, developed by Adeline Software International in 1994. 
Time Commando is a 1996 action-adventure not part of the LBA series but sharing the same engine utilities.
Little Big Adventure 2 (aka Twinsen's Odyssey) is the sequel released in 1997.

## Build

> cmake -S src -B build

> cmake --build build --target lba1
> cmake --build build --target lba2

Eventually once we have lba1 and lba2 working separately we can try to build a single target for both as openlba.
